(Read me: how can we use your program)

How can we use your program?

Our program is loosely based on the Simons effect which states that a response time of a participant is generally less accurate and slower when the stimulus and response are on opposite sides. The participant will be shown an image of a goat or sheep and must react according to the instructions (‘left key for sheep’ or ‘left key for goat’). If stimulus is not shown (e.g., a picture of a goat in the time of the instructions ‘left key for sheep), the participant must press the right arrow key. Otherwise, they must click the left arrow key. The response time of the participants, as well as their key click, is recorded and plotted together. All the participant must do is download expyriment (“pip install – no-deps expyriment”), pandas (“pip install pandas”) and matplot. Just before starting the experiment, each user must change the paths of the images and csv file according to where they placed it (lines: 96/98/...). After clicking on “run” to execute the program, the participants must click the correct key in the quickest time and enjoy the cute images of goats and sheep!

- Additional modules that have to be downloaded: expyriment (“pip install –no-deps               expyriment”), pandas (“pip install pandas”), matplot, keyboard
- Command for executing the program: run
- Reusable functions ??
- Changing paths in code if neccessary


Programming Journey

What additional things did you learn during the project? / What challenges did you face? / How did you approach them?

The main thing that we had to work with during our project was expyriment, which took a while for us to get along with. The most issues also popped up due to our lack of knowledge with expyriment. Working with data, images as well as the keyboard added to the issues in expyriment. To conquer these issues, we mainly used the expyriment website, google and online platforms. Another issue that we faced later on in our project was working with csv files and plotting. We needed to get a better understanding and work more in depth with both things. Especially plotting, we were unsure which data to plot and how. We tested many different plot types with all the different data. We came to the conclusion that using the Reaction Time would be best, leaving our further data(another possibility can be seen in the comments after the first figure is created). However, after choosing one plot possibility, we had difficulties adding the mean to the plot to create a comparison point. Through trying out many different possibilities after research and deepening our knowledge with mean calculations and merging plots, we figured it out.

What further additions could be made?

We could have added more stimuli and to make it more interactive some audio as well. Our plotting could have been more advanced with saving each result to a database and having a visualisation of the performance of the individual participant in relation to the average from the database

- Additional things we learned: expyriment, pandas, working with images and data (paths),     working with csv in more depth, using keyboard as respoonse device,…
- Challenges we faced: installation, including images, turning xpd to csv, plotting
- Approach to challenges: google, following link in errormessage (for installation problem)   example experiments on github, asking other coxis with more python experience for help
- Further additions that could be made: audio stimuli, more different pictures, more          different categories, saving each result to a database and having a visualisation of the    performance of the individual participant in relation to the average from the              database,...
