#How can we use your program?

#Our program is loosely based on the Simons effect which states that a response time of a #participant is generally less accurate and slower when the stimulus and response are on #opposite sides. The participant will be shown an image of a goat or sheep and must react #according to the instructions (‘left key for sheep’ or ‘left key for goat’). If stimulus is not shown (e.g., a picture of a goat in the time of the instructions ‘left key for sheep), the participant must press the right arrow key. Otherwise, they must click the left arrow key. The response time of the participants, as well as their key click, is recorded and plotted together. All the participant must do is download expyriment (“pip install – no-deps expyriment”), pandas (“pip install pandas”) and matplot. Just before starting the experiment, each user must change the paths of the images and csv file according to where they placed it (lines: 96/98/...). After clicking on “run” to execute the program, the participants must click the correct key in the quickest time and enjoy the cute images of goats and sheep!
